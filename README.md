# biztory-feedback-email
The emails we send around to clients to gather feedback. This is where we design them and potentially host some of the content used.

The one example we do use is not the bootstrap or not the Unlayer one, but the titled `biztory-client-feedback.html` where we use simple table "logic" for the layout.
